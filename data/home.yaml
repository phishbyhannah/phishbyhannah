  paragraphs:
    - "Water shaped my life long before it shaped my work. I built PHISH through seasons spent in Ningaloo, Tonga, Raja Ampat and beyond. In environments that demand awareness, patience and respect."
    - "I am not interested in curated travel narratives. I am interested in the lived experience of a place. In trust. In access that is earned, not staged."
    - "There is so much beauty in this world. I feel incredibly fortunate to witness it. I also feel a quiet urgency to document it - so it is remembered, respected, and cared for long after the moment has passed."
    - "My background in marketing and brand strategy informs how I work. It ensures the images do more than look beautiful. They function." 
    - "PHISH exists to hold both of those truths."

  body:
    - "Living there changed the scale of everything. I watched the reef shift across seasons. I watched whale sharks arrive and disappear. I watched landscapes I thought were permanent evolve."
    - "Being able to document that felt like a privilege. It also felt heavy."
    - "The work stopped being about producing content. It became about witnessing."
    - "As simple as it sounds, I realised photographs can shift perspective. They can move someone from passive admiration to actual care."
    - "That changed how I approach everything."

  title: "The Day That Redirected My Life"
  body:
    - "Before I was a guide, I was a guest."
    - "On my first whale shark and humpback whale tour, I remember everything - the briefing, the nerves, the first glimpse of shadow beneath me."
    - "I swam with a whale shark and whales in the same day. At the time, it was the best day of my life."
    - "But what stayed with me most wasn’t just the animals. It was the people facilitating it - the guide, the photographer, the crew. I realised this wasn’t just an experience. It was a profession. A way of shaping someone’s relationship with the natural world."
    - "I told myself I would come back and work here."
    - "Now, guiding in Ningaloo and Tonga, I see that same moment on guests’ faces. The disbelief. The quiet. The recalibration."
    - "I understand that feeling because it changed my trajectory too."
    - "That understanding informs how I shoot. I’m not just documenting wildlife. I’m documenting threshold moments - when something shifts for someone."

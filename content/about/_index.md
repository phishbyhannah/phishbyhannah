---

Hi, I’m Hannah — an underwater photographer, content creator, and social media manager who’s swapped life on land for one mostly spent in saltwater.

I blend my marketing background with a deep love for the ocean to help brands tell stronger, more strategic stories that still feel like *them*.

Whether I’m in the water capturing moments beneath the surface, or on land shaping brand identity, voice, and visuals, my focus is the same: intentional content that’s engaging, true to your values, and built to support your digital presence.

I’m creative, but practical — and I care about building communities, not just chasing attention.
